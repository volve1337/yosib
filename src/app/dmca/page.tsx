                        YosiBreak operates in a legal gray area. Copyright laws vary significantly from country to country, and the legality of streaming services can be complex and subject to interpretation.

                    <p>
                        YosiBreak does not host any content on our servers. We simply provide links to media hosted on third-party services that are publicly available on the internet.
