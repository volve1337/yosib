## ✨ Features

### 🎬 1. Cinematic Watch Experience
* **Adaptive Multi-Server Video Player:** Stream movies and TV shows instantly through a custom `VideoPlayer` supporting multiple source servers, theater mode, autoplay overrides, and seamless quality selection.
* **Resume Playback:** Pick up exactly where you left off. The app remembers your viewing progress across multiple seasons and movies.
* **Trailer Modals:** Instant overlays that play high-definition YouTube trailers, teasers, and clips directly inside the browser.
* **Season & Episode Trackers:** Elegant interactive episode dropdowns and carousels showcasing episode runtimes, release dates, and high-res stills.

### 🏢 2. Studios & Networks Hub
* **Production Studios Catalog:** A dedicated explorer for iconic entertainment conglomerates like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney, Warner Bros, A24, and Studio Ghibli.
* **TV Networks Grid:** Browse premium streaming channels (Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Apple TV+, Prime Video) with dynamic media feeds.
* **Infinite Scroll Delivery:** Fluid, modern paging utilizing the browser's native `IntersectionObserver` to append additional shows and movies in real-time as you browse.

### 💖 3. Hyper-Customized Client Storage
* **Watchlist:** Save your favorite titles for later inside a clean, beautiful horizontal row sync.
* **Recently Played Carousel:** Instant access to your watch history directly on the home page so you can resume active media in one click.
* **No-Lag Client Syncing:** Uses an optimized dual-layered in-memory cache system to bypass slow localStorage reads and dispatches custom state-update events (`watchlistUpdated`, `recentlyPlayedUpdated`) for smooth multi-tab sync.

### 📊 4. Advanced Discovery, Filters & Search
* **Unified Instant Search:** Rapidly search and parse results across multi-layered queries: Movies, TV Shows, Actors, Directors, and Production Companies.
* **Refined Genre and Date Filters:** Deep discovery tools that sort matching movies by release year, genre tags, popularity, ratings, or custom criteria.
* **Dynamic Title Hero Carousel:** An auto-sliding dashboard on the landing page that pulls trending items and asynchronously resolves dynamic title typography logos for an authentic theatre feel.

### 💬 5. Authentic Community Reviews
* **Moctale API Integration:** Incorporates a custom scraper powered by `got-scraping` that asynchronously pulls, sanitizes, and displays authentic movie and show reviews directly on details dashboards.

### 🛡️ 6. Seamless Streaming Extras
* **Ad Blocker Detection:** A subtle, helpful overlay dialog that alerts users if aggressive ad blockers are interfering with streaming server endpoints, ensuring reliable video playback.
* **Exit Page Transitions:** Fluid entry and exit page animations designed with `framer-motion` for a true app-like experience.
